INTERFACES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ntirc supports several different "interfaces," or ways to use the client. Each interface
turns the client into something different than another interface. The following interfaces
exist at this time:

    * Gtk2       - an all-in-one GTK+2 graphical interface based on WebKit.
    * Gtk3       - an all-in-one GTK+3 graphical interface based on WebKit.
    * Core       - a core-only (no GUI) interface used by a Gtk#Client.
    * Gtk2Client - a GTK+2 WebKit client which uses a remote Core.
    * Gtk3Client - a GTK+3 WebKit client which uses a remote Core.
    * Bot        - an extremely basic IRC bot for experimenting with libirc.


BUGS (and annoyances)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in Interface::Base::Generic:

    * the nick pane on the left does not stretch to the bottom of the buffer.
    * buffer does not automatically lock to the bottom of the scrollable pane.
